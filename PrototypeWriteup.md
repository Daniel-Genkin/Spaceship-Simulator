# Prototype
For this prototype we aimed to have all the basic functionality of the final simulation implemented. Currently, we have achieved this, albeit with a few bugs. This functionality includes basic procedural planet generation, basic camera/ship controls, basic obj/mtl file loading, 3d model rendering, procedurally generated quests, basic UI, and basic lighting/shadows. More details about each specific feature can be found in the [README.md](./README.md) file. Currently, everything is functional. However, there are a few things we would like to iterate upon. For example, the object loading and planet generation are quite slow. So, we would like to either add a loading screen or maybe use some more efficient methods. The ship rotation is another area we would like to improve and make more realistic.

Going forward, we would like to cleanup the graphics, improve performance and make the whole project work smoother and feel more realistic. This will involve adding animations and a few more material properties to help make the simulation look better. As per our original proposal, we will also make the outposts give the player new quests, add collision avoidence with planets and maybe a few of our stretch goals that we listed. Overall, all these changes will make the final simulation feel a lot more polished and help to convey a more realistic experience!
